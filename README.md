# mdb_corel10k

This image is made to permit the installation of the corel-10k dataset in a given volume.
The files will be copied into the `/install/` directory. The directory will be recursively chmod 777.

This docker image is made available because the website of the corel-10k dataset is down. Do not use the dataset for an other purpose than what is allowed by the dataset authors. (It can only be used for academic communication and cannot be used in commercial products).
